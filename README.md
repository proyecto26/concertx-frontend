## Inspiration

ConcertX was inspired by the success of crowdfunding platforms like **Kickstarter**, which have helped countless creative projects come to life through the support of backers. However, we noticed that there was a lack of options specifically geared towards musicians and concert events. We wanted to create a platform that would allow musicians to easily set up funding campaigns for their concerts, and offer unique rewards to their backers as a way of thanking them for their support.

Additionally, we were inspired by the potential of using blockchain technology to create a more decentralized and transparent crowdfunding platform. By using smart contracts, we can enable trusted transactions directly between musicians and their backers without the need for a central authority. This not only helps to reduce fees and barriers to entry, but also allows musicians to have more control over their own careers and creative processes.

Overall, ConcertX aims to empower musicians and help bring unique concerts to life through the support of their fans and backers. We believe that by using innovative technologies like blockchain and virtual reality, we can create an immersive and revolutionary concert experience for both musicians and their audiences.

## What it does?

ConcertX is a crowfunding platform that helps musicians bring their concerts to life through the support of backers. Musicians can set up campaigns on the platform and set a funding goal and deadline. Backers can then pledge money towards the campaign in order to help it reach its goal. In return, musicians offer unique rewards to their backers as a way of thanking them for their support.

In addition to funding concerts, ConcertX also allows musicians to share their rehearsals in recording studios and broadcast live to their fans and backers. This gives fans an inside look at the creative process and allows them to interact with the musicians in real time.

ConcertX also supports **Recording Studios** by allowing them to receive rewards for broadcasting live events. This helps to create a more sustainable ecosystem for musicians and recording studios, and allows them to collaborate and support one another in their careers.

In the case of ConcertX, blockchain technology is used to enable trusted transactions directly between musicians and their backers. This means that when someone pledges money towards a campaign on ConcertX, the transaction is recorded on a special database called a "blockchain." This helps to make sure that the transaction is secure and can't be changed or tampered with.

So, in summary, ConcertX is a platform that helps musicians raise money for their concerts, and uses special technology called "blockchain" to make the transactions secure and trustworthy.

## How we built it?

ConcertX was built using a combination of technologies and frameworks to create a decentralized crowdfunding platform for musicians; as a team of passionate musicians and technologists, we have always been frustrated by the lack of options for musicians to fund their concerts. That's why we decided to create ConcertX, a revolutionary new crowdfunding platform for musicians.

We started by researching our target audience and identifying their needs and motivations. We then sketch out our solution, determining how the platform would function and what features it would have.

Next, we chose the technologies that we would use to build the platform. We selected a combination of Solidity, Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink Oracles for the smart contracts, and used Metamask and web3.js to enable users to connect using their wallets. On the front-end, we used ReactJS, RemixJS, TailwindCSS, and Hardhat to build a sleek and user-friendly interface. And for the back-end, we utilized NodeJS with the Express framework to power our services.

With these technologies in hand, we set to work building a prototype of the platform. Looking back, it's amazing to see how far we've come. Building ConcertX has been a challenging but rewarding journey, and we can't wait to see what the future holds for this revolutionary platform.

## Challenges we ran into

There are a number of challenges that we faced while building **ConcertX**:

1. **Technical challenges:** Building a platform like **ConcertX** involves working with complex technologies like Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and Web development. This equire a steep learning curve and a lot of trial and error.
2. **User experience challenges:** Ensuring that the platform is intuitive and easy to use for both musicians and backers is really important. This involve gathering feedback and iterating on the design to find the right balance.
3. **Marketing and outreach challenges:** Getting the word out about ConcertX and convincing musicians and backers to use the platform is crucial. This involve developing a marketing and outreach strategy and building partnerships with relevant organizations and festivals like **Tomorrowland**.
4. **Legal and regulatory challenges:** Operating a crowdfunding platform comes with a number of legal and regulatory considerations. It is necessary to consult with legal counsel and ensure that the platform complies with relevant laws and regulations.
5. **Competition:** There are other crowdfunding platforms targeting the same audience as ConcertX. It's important to differentiate the platform and offer unique value to users in order to stand out.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
